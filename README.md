# Semantic-Textual-Similarity

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given two paragraphs, quantify the degree of similarity between the two text-based on Semantic
similarity. Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) assesses the degree to which two sentences are
semantically equivalent to each other. The STS task is motivated by the observation that accurately
modelling the meaning similarity of sentences is a foundational language understanding problem
relevant to numerous applications including machine translation (MT), summarization, generation,
question-answering (QA), short answer grading, semantic search.
STS is the assessment of pairs of sentences according to their degree of semantic similarity. The task
involves producing real-valued similarity scores for sentence pairs.

The data contains a pair of paragraphs. These text paragraphs are randomly sampled from a raw
dataset. Each pair of the sentence may or may not be semantically similar. The candidate is to
predict a value between 0-1 indicating a degree of similarity between the pair of text paras.

1 means highly similar
0 means highly dissimilar
